      A double-walled sac called the pericardium encases the heart, which serves

      the serous pericardium, runs pericardial fluid, which lubricates
      the heart during

and allow me to listen, to decipher.
And these were the elements of my Mother,
the earthed wire, the burning cable,
as if she flowed into the room with

back towards me.
